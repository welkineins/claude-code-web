## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Notice

**IMPORTANT: This application is very powerful and should only be used in secure environments.**

- üè† **Local Network Only**: Only run this on your private network (home/office)
- üö´ **No Public Access**: Never expose this to the internet or public networks
- üë§ **Personal Use**: Only you should have access to this interface
- üîí **Additional Security**: For enhanced security, consider running in a sandbox environment

**Why this matters**: Claude Code has full access to your computer's filesystem and can execute commands. This web interface provides the same level of access through a browser, which could be dangerous if accessed by unauthorized users.

## üöÄ Quick Setup

### What You Need

- **Node.js** 16.0.0 or newer ([Download here](https://nodejs.org/))
- **Claude Code CLI** installed and working ([Setup instructions](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/claude-code))

### Installation

1. **Download this project**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd claude-code-web-ui
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   cd client && npm install && cd ..
   ```

3. **Build the application**
   ```bash

   ```

5. **Open your browser**
   - Go to `http://localhost:3001`
   - You should see the Claude Code Web interface

## üìñ How to Use

### Starting Your First Session

1. **Open the web interface** at `http://localhost:3001`
2. **Choose a working directory** - this is where Claude will work (like `/Users/yourname/Documents/myproject`)
3. **Click "Start Session"**
4. **Start chatting with Claude** in the terminal interface

### Managing Multiple Sessions

- **View All Sessions**: Click "Active Sessions" to see all running Claude sessions
- **Switch Sessions**: Click "Reconnect" to switch between different sessions
- **Create New Sessions**: Click "New Session" to start additional Claude instances
- **Remove Sessions**: Click "Remove" to stop a session when you're done

### Session Features

- **Persistent Sessions**: Claude keeps running even if you close your browser
- **Reconnect Anytime**: Close and reopen your browser - your sessions will still be there
- **Multiple Projects**: Run Claude in different directories for different projects
- **Mobile Friendly**: Works on phones and tablets too

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Server Won't Start

**Error: Port already in use**
```bash
# Find what's using port 3001
lsof -i :3001
# Kill the process or use a different port
```

**Error: Claude command not found**
```bash
# Check if Claude CLI is installed
which claude
# If not found, install Claude Code CLI first
```

## üì± Mobile Usage

The interface works on mobile devices:
- Touch-friendly controls
- Responsive design
- Swipe gestures for session management

Access the same URL (`http://your-computer-ip:3001`) from your phone while on the same network.
